    <description>By default, Sacrifice Rooms allow you to teleport to the Dark Room. This mod allows you to teleport to more ending destinations:
[list]
    [*]Dark Room / The Lamb
    [*]Chest / ???
    [*]The Void / Delirium
    [*]Corpse II / Mother
    [*]Home / The Beast
[/list]

You can also teleport to other important story levels:
[list]
    [*]Basement I / Restart
    [*]Depths II / Mom
    [*]Mausoleum II / Mom
    [*]Mausoleum II / Dad's Note
    [*]Womb II / Mom's Heart
    [*]??? / Hush
    [*]Sheol / Satan
    [*]Cathedral / Isaac
[/list]

Unfortunately, the [i]StartStageTransition[/i] function can randomly crash the game. As a workaround, to show the proper stage transition animation, we'll give Dream Catcher starting on the 12th spike hit.

Mod Config Menu will let you change the probability for each destination. Since you'll be getting key pieces from Sacrifice Rooms, there's also options to enable some extra functionality:
[list]
    [*]Open the red room closet in Home with key pieces
    [*]Transform the key pieces into knife pieces in the Mausoleum II boss fight (only if you don't have a full knife)
[/list]

EID (External Item Descriptions) support has been added. There's now an option to spoil your teleportation destination.

Note: There's an edge case where if you use a Sacrifice Room in the Dark Room, it will just teleport you back to the starting room rather than taking you somewhere new. This mod doesn't try to override that case.</description>
